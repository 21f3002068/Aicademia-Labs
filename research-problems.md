# Top 3 Initial Research Problems

1. Efficient Unlearning via Model Surgery

Can we remove specific class/task knowledge from deep models without full retraining?

Goal: Minimize compute and maximize fidelity post-unlearning.

2. Responsible AI Scorecard

Create a universal audit toolkit to rate models across fairness, interpretability, unlearning ease, and misuse potential.

Goal: A plug-and-play library that works on HuggingFace + TensorFlow.

3. Mapping AI Policy to Model Constraints

Translate high-level AI regulations (e.g., EU AI Act, India Digital Act) into concrete architectural or training constraints.

Goal: Build a sandbox where developers can simulate policy compliance.
